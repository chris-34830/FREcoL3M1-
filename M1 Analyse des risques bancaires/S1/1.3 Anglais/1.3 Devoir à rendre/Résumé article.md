##### Dual dominance
In the modern era, banks occupy a central role that surpasses their economic significance. They not only establish a tangible presence, with their logos gracing the skylines of major cities worldwide, but also exert substantial influence on individuals and businesses. The article in The Economist underscores this dual influence, emphasizing that banks play an essential role in every economic transaction. The historical development of banks can be traced to the fundamental need to protect money. In the beginning, institutions were established to guarantee the safety of financial assets. Over time, the demand for secure financial transactions gave rise to the emergence of modern banks. Nevertheless, the article prompts inquiries into whether the visible presence of banks corresponds to their economic importance. Modern banks no longer require an exact cash reserve matching the total deposits since not all account holders withdraw funds simultaneously. This has prompted some economists to scrutinize the connection between individuals and businesses, particularly emphasizing the critical role of liquidity in sustaining business operations.
##### Are banks capable of withstanding the impact of emerging technology?
The article emphasizes the indisputable economic supremacy of banks, highlighting that in 2020, the top 1000 banks collectively possessed a market capitalization of \$128 trillion and played a part in generating \$84.5 trillion for the global gross product. Nevertheless, despite their present preeminence, banks confront challenges from technological progress, capital markets, and government involvement. Technology behemoths have introduced streamlined payment systems that could diminish the dependency on conventional banking methods. This transformation presents hurdles to the traditional systems of financial regulation and monetary policy, which have historically been rooted in the operations of banks.
It's essential to recognize that the nature of banking sets it apart from numerous other industries impacted by technological changes. Banks function as the crucial link between the government and the economy, characterized by well-established structures that have, for the most part, remained unchanged since the 18th century. Nevertheless, a new financial landscape is taking shape, opening the door to the prospect that banks may assume a reduced or even non-existent role. This emerging scenario envisions digital currency and deposits supplied by central banks, technology companies managing financial transactions, and capital markets providing credit.
#### Is a world without bank desirable?
The fundamental inquiry revolves around whether a world without banks is something we would desire. Despite the flaws seen in banks, like excluding the unbanked and occasionally causing economic instability, their function is deeply entwined with the machinery of capitalism. Over time, banks have played a central role in directing dormant funds toward investment prospects. If central banks were to take on a more substantial role, this could entail a greater engagement in credit markets.
Furthermore, the shift towards a world devoid of banks presents wider social implications. State-backed digital currencies and privately operated payment systems have the capacity to centralize authority in a few specific entities, giving rise to worries about governments or private organizations gaining access to extensive personal data of citizens. This centralization of power may also increase the susceptibility of these entities to cyberattacks, potentially jeopardizing national security. Digital currency, in addition, carries the potential for programmed regulations, offering both advantages, like more precise distribution of welfare, and disadvantages, including the potential imposition of restrictions on certain financial transactions.
##### Conclusion
The article emphasizes the pivotal and multifaceted role of banks in today's world, having transformed from their traditional role as custodians of financial assets into economic behemoths. However, technological advancements, capital markets, and government intervention now pose challenges to their preeminence.
The transformation of the financial landscape could potentially marginalize or even eliminate traditional banks, giving way to digital currencies, central bank deposits, and tech-enabled financial transactions. This shift raises critical questions about the desirability of a world without banks, given their historical role in channeling funds to investment and their deep ties to capitalism. However, this change also carries broader societal implications, such as concerns about centralized power, privacy, cybersecurity, and the potential for programmed controls on digital currencies. The future of banking is at a crossroads, with profound economic, societal, and security considerations at stake.
##### Personnal thoughts
My personal viewpoint is that, despite the upcoming changes the banking sector must embrace to accommodate evolving technological demands, I don't believe that traditional banks are destined for extinction. The rise in popularity of online banks, backed by well-established entities in the banking industry, serves as a protective measure against technological disruptions. These online banks are effectively adapting to and incorporating new technologies into their digital services, and in some cases, even innovating their own tech solutions.
Nonetheless, looking further ahead, I anticipate that traditional banks will have a more limited role in the future compared to their present scope. I foresee payment systems evolving to the point where they are no longer exclusively the domain of banks, with private enterprises entering the market, as mentioned in the article. However, I don't believe we'll find a complete replacement for the conventional deposit system.
Consider the case of Lydia, a French unicorn specializing in mobile payment services, which has recently sought accreditation to become a full-fledged banking institution. Could it be that, barring significant political disruptions, the new technologies and companies aiming to revolutionize the banking sector will eventually evolve into full-fledged banking institutions regardless?
Furthermore, the 2008 financial crisis serves as a compelling example of the adverse outcomes that can result from the deregulation of the banking system. This crisis, partly instigated by the elimination of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, a move that dissolved the longstanding divide between commercial and investment banks, stands as a clear indication of the risks tied to banking deregulation.
